# Restaurant Revenue Prediction Using Machine Learning 

## 📌 Project Description  
This project aims to predict the revenue of restaurants based on key features like location, cuisine type, ratings, reviews, and more. Using machine learning techniques, we developed and evaluated models that achieve high accuracy in predictions.

## 📂 Dataset  
We utilized the [Restaurant Revenue Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonytherrien/restaurant-revenue-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle, which contains **17 features** and a target variable:  

### Features Overview:
- **Name:** The name of the restaurant.  
- **Location:** Urban/Rural/Downtown.  
- **Cuisine:** Type of cuisine (e.g., Italian, Japanese).  
- **Rating:** Average restaurant rating.  
- **Seating Capacity:** Number of seats available.  
- **Average Meal Price:** Average price per meal.  
- **Marketing Budget:** Marketing budget allocated.  
- **Social Media Followers:** Number of social media followers.  
- **Chef Experience Years:** Years of experience of the head chef.  
- **Number of Reviews:** Total number of reviews received.  
- **Avg Review Length:** Average length of reviews.  
- **Ambience Score:** A score representing the ambience.  
- **Service Quality Score:** A score representing the service quality.  
- **Parking Availability:** Indicates parking availability (Yes/No).  
- **Weekend Reservations:** Number of weekend reservations.  
- **Weekday Reservations:** Number of weekday reservations.  
- **Revenue:** Total revenue generated (Target Variable).

## 🛠️ Project Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing/null values.  
- Encoded categorical variables.  
- Analyzed feature relationships using heatmaps.  

### 2️⃣ Modeling  
- Implemented **Random Forest Regressor** and **Linear Regression** models.  
- Evaluated models using:  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
  - **R² Score**  

### 3️⃣ Dimensionality Reduction  
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction.  
- Visualized feature relationships in 3D.  

---

## 🎯 Results  
- Achieved **99% accuracy** on both training and testing datasets.  

---

## 📈 Visualizations  
- Heatmaps showing feature correlations.  
- 3D visualizations of PCA-transformed data.  

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Pandas, NumPy for data preprocessing.  
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization.  
  - Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation.
